# Auto-MPG Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Auto-MPG dataset, which contains characteristics of cars manufactured between 1970 and 1982 from Europe, Japan, and the USA. The dataset comprises information on 261 cars, including attributes such as miles per gallon (MPG), cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin.

## Dataset Preprocessing
Before conducting the analysis, we performed data preprocessing to ensure the dataset's quality and prepare it for further investigation. This preprocessing involved:
- Handling missing values
- Dealing with outliers
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

## Data Analysis Approach
In our analysis, we aimed to identify patterns, relationships, and trends within the dataset to gain insights into the factors influencing the fuel efficiency (MPG) of cars. We employed various analytical techniques, including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize the distribution of variables and detect correlations
- Statistical analysis to quantify relationships and assess significance
- Utilizing machine learning models, such as clustering algorithms, to uncover hidden patterns and groupings in the data

## Results and Conclusions
The result of the analysis are provided in the pdf files
In conclusion, our analysis provides valuable insights and can be improved by using more sophisticated approaches
